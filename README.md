# OpenCL


In this study I implemented Powershift method using OpenCL 
It seems like the code you've provided is written in a programming language, but the syntax is not specified. Based on the structure, it appears to be a mix of pseudocode and some parallel processing comments.

Here's a brief breakdown of what seems to be happening:

1. Initialize `eigvec1` as a vector of ones with dimensions 12x1.
2. Perform power iteration for finding the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector for matrix `A`. The iteration is done 10 times.
   - Multiply `A` by `eigvec1`.
   - Normalize `eigvec1`.
   - Calculate the eigenvalue `eigval1` as the inner product of `eigvec1` with `A * eigvec1`.
3. Update `B` as `A - eigval1 * (eigvec1 * eigvec1^T)`.
4. Perform another set of power iteration for finding the second largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector for matrix `B`. The iteration is done 10 times.
   - Multiply `B` by `eigvec2`.
   - Normalize `eigvec2`.
   - Calculate the eigenvalue `eigval2` as the inner product of `x^T * B * x` (Note: `x` is not defined in the provided code).

The comments indicate that certain operations are intended to be done in parallel, suggesting that the algorithm could potentially benefit from parallel processing. However, the actual implementation details and the programming language used are not specified in the provided code. If you have a specific question or need help with a particular aspect of the code, please let me

eigvec1 = ones(12,1);

for (i=0; i<10; i++)        
    eigvec1 = A * eigvec1;    // this will be done in parallel        
    eigvec1 = eigvec1/norm(eigvec1); // this will be done in parallel
    eigval1 = eigvec1^T * A * eigvec1; // this will be done in parallel
end

eigvec2 = ones(12,1);

B = A - eigval1 * (eigvec1 * eigvec1^T);  
// eigval1 and eigvec1 are the largest eigenvalue and its eigenvector of A
// this will be done in parallel

for (i=0; i<10; i++)       
    eigvec2 = B * eigvec2;    // this will be done in parallel        
    eigvec2 = eigvec2/norm(eigvec2); // this will be done in parallel
    eigval2 = x^T * B * x;
end
